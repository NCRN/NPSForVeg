 + Fixed - fixed error with getPlots that prevented the command from being exported and introduced typos into the help file.

2016-02-19 NPSForVeg 0.2.0

+ added: NEWS file 

+ added: importERMN() importMIDN() and importNETN() functions so that data from those networks can be used.

+ fixed: make() will now work when a plot size is NA. This occurs when a type of vegetation (such as vines) is
         not monitored in a park. Note that when you have a list of parks with different sized plots, dens() will not be 
         able to make per area density estimates.
